# Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

In this step, you will prepare your computer to run React applications.
Do not skip this step, even if you are eager to write code.

React requires a few tools to work properly.
Each tool is explained below in simple terms.

---

## Tool 1: Node.js

Node.js allows your computer to run JavaScript outside the browser.
React uses Node.js to install libraries and run development servers.

Without Node.js, React applications cannot run.

### How to check if Node.js is installed

Open a terminal and run:

        node -v


- If you see a version number, Node.js is installed.
- If you get an error, Node.js is not installed.

### Install Node.js (if not installed)

Download and install the **LTS version** from the official website:

[https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

After installation:
1. Restart your terminal
2. Run `node -v` again to confirm it works

---

## Tool 2: npm (Node Package Manager)

npm comes with Node.js.
It is used to download and manage libraries needed by React.

Check npm by running:

        npm -v


- If a version number appears, npm is working.
- If not, reinstall Node.js from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

## Tool 3: Code Editor

You need a code editor to write React code.
A code editor helps you read, write, and organize files.

### Recommended Editor

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

Download VS Code from:

[https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)

You can use another editor if you prefer, but all examples in this repository assume VS Code.

## What You Should Have Before Continuing

Before moving to the next step, make sure:
- Node.js is installed
- npm works in the terminal
- A code editor is installed and ready
