# Step 2: React Basics

In this step, you will learn the core ideas of React.

React allows you to create **interactive websites** using **components**.
Even though the term "component" may sound complicated, it’s just a **piece of UI** that you can reuse.

## What You Will Learn Here

- What a React component is
- How to create a simple component
- How to render it in the app
- How React updates the UI automatically

## First Example: Simple Component

Follow the instructions in the code to create your first React component.
The actual code is inside `src/components/Hello.jsx`.

## Key Points for Beginners

- Every component is a **function that returns JSX**
- JSX looks like HTML but is **JavaScript under the hood**
- You can reuse components anywhere by importing them
