# Step 2: React Basics & Creating Your First App

In this step, you will create your first React application and understand the basic concepts behind it.

This step assumes you have completed **Step 1 – Environment Setup**.

## What Is React?

React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces.
It allows you to create reusable components and manage UI state efficiently.

React applications are built using:
- Components
- JSX (JavaScript + HTML)
- State and Props

You will learn these concepts practically.

## Creating Your First React App

We will use **Create React App**, a beginner-friendly tool.

### Step 1: Open the terminal

Open a terminal in the folder where you want to create your project.

### Step 2: Create the React app

Run the following command:

    npx create-react-app react-app


This command:
- Downloads required tools
- Creates a ready-to-use React project
- Sets up a development server

### Step 3: Move into the project folder

    cd my-first-react-app


### Step 4: Start the development server

    npm start


Open browser at:

http://localhost:5173

You have successfully created your first React app 🎉

## Understanding the Project Structure

Important folders and files:

- `src/` → Where your React code lives
- `public/` → Static files
- `src/App.js` → Main component
- `src/index.js` → App entry point

Do not worry if this looks confusing.
Each part will be explained step by step in later sections.
