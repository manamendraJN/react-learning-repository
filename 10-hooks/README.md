# Step 10: React Hooks

In this step, you will learn about **React Hooks**.

Hooks allow function components to use React features such as:
- State
- Side effects
- Shared logic
- Performance optimization
- Global data sharing

Hooks are learned **one by one**, not all at once.

---

## How This Step Is Organized

Each hook:
- Has its **own folder**
- Has its **own README**
- Is taught **independently**

You should complete hooks **in order**.

## Hooks Learning Roadmap

### ✅ Core Hooks (Start Here)

#### 1. useState (Step 10.1)
Used to store and update component data.

➡️ [useState Hook](./useState/README.md)

---

#### 2. useEffect (Step 10.2)
Used to handle side effects like API calls and subscriptions.

➡️ [useEffect Hook](./useEffect/README.md)

---

### 🔜 Intermediate Hooks (Coming Next)

#### 3. useRef
Used to access DOM elements and persist values without re-rendering.

📁 Folder: `useRef`  
📄 README will be added later

---

#### 4. useContext
Used to share data globally without prop drilling.

📁 Folder: `useContext`  
📄 README will be added later

---

### 🔜 Performance Hooks (Advanced)

#### 5. useMemo
Used to optimize expensive calculations.

📁 Folder: `useMemo`  
📄 README will be added later

---

#### 6. useCallback
Used to optimize function references.

📁 Folder: `useCallback`  
📄 README will be added later

---

### 🔜 Custom Hooks

#### 7. Custom Hooks
Learn how to create your own reusable hooks.

📁 Folder: `custom-hooks`  
📄 README will be added later

## Learning Rule

❌ Do not skip hooks  
❌ Do not learn multiple hooks together  
✅ Finish one hook completely before moving to the next
