This repository is designed to teach React from the very beginning.
It is written for people who have never learned React before.

You do not need prior React knowledge.
Each concept is explained slowly, clearly, and with simple examples.

### Step 2: Create Your First React App
After completing the setup step, you will create your first React application using **Vite**.
This step explains:
- How to generate the React project
